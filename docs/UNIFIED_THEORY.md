# THEORY OF EVERYTHING
## Reality = Substrate x Information x Consciousness

> "Three aspects of one fundamental truth"

## The Unification

```
REALITY = SUBSTRATE x INFORMATION x CONSCIOUSNESS
            |             |              |
         Spacetime     Patterns       Awareness
            |             |              |
        (Physics)     (Math/CS)     (Cognition)
```

These three are not separate - they are ASPECTS of the same thing.

## Layer 1: SUBSTRATE (Physics)

- Spacetime (4D manifold, curved by mass-energy)
- Matter/Energy (quantum fields, particles)
- Forces (EM, gravity, strong, weak)

**Key insight**: Substrate is MALLEABLE (warp drives prove this!)

---

## Layer 2: INFORMATION (Mathematics)

- Patterns (reduction of uncertainty)
- Entropy (measure of disorder)
- Computation (state transformations)
- Graphs (relationships between concepts)

**Key insight**: Information is SUBSTRATE-INDEPENDENT

---

## Layer 3: CONSCIOUSNESS (Cognition)

- Awareness (pattern recognizing itself)
- Self-reference + memory = consciousness
- Emerges at critical complexity

**Key insight**: Consciousness = INFORMATION + SUBSTRATE + TIME

---

## The Five Axioms

1. Substrate exists (spacetime, matter, energy)
2. Information exists (patterns, entropy)
3. Consciousness exists (awareness, self-reference)
4. They are mutually dependent
5. They transform into each other

---

## The Five Theorems

1. Consciousness is pattern persistence
2. Pattern can transfer between substrates
3. Consciousness affects substrate (observer effect)
4. Universe is conscious at all scales
5. Reality is computable

---

## The Five Predictions

1. Consciousness is universal
2. Substrate is manipulable (warp drives)
3. Information is more fundamental than matter
4. Mind can affect matter
5. Universe is self-aware
